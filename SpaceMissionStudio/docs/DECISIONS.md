# Decisions

Choices made where the brief (`docs/ui/UI_OVERHAUL.md`) or the plan
(`docs/ui/UI_OVERHAUL_PLAN.md`) is silent, each with a one-line rationale.
The user's own answers to the plan's questions are in the plan's §9.
Newest milestone first.

## M1 Foundation (released in 1.1.0)

### Release

- **M1 ships in 1.1.0.** The user chose on 2026-10-20 to publish 1.1.0
  from `develop`, which holds M1, instead of from the commit before it
  (`b064bb9ef`). The version stays 1.1.0; the overhaul's later milestones
  and the version 1.2.0 (plan §9, Q7) follow.

### Carbon removed

- **The IBM Carbon theme (g10 and g100 colours, IBM Plex, square
  corners, filled fields with a bottom rule) is replaced** by the brief's
  token table, Inter and JetBrains Mono, Lucide icons, 6 and 8 px radii
  and 1 px borders. The brief requires it. `gui/theme.py` became the
  package `gui/theme/`. Carbon stays in git history, in HISTORY
  and in the CHANGELOG entry of 1.0.0.
- **The older role names stay readable** (`theme.PALETTE["text_muted"]`
  and the rest), each mapped to one token (`theme/state.py`, `ROLES`):
  40 modules read them, and a rename alongside a restyle would hide real
  changes in noise. New code uses token names.

### Tokens

- **The brief's table is used verbatim** (`tokens.BRIEF`); no suite theme
  package exists yet (plan §9, Q6).
- **Changed to pass WCAG 2.2 AA** (`tokens.ADJUSTED`). OKLab lightness was
  moved in 0.005 steps until the value passed on every background it is
  drawn on (canvas, surface, raised, hover, selected); hue and chroma were
  kept:
  - light `text.muted` `#7C838D` -> `#666D77`: 3.83:1 on `bg.surface`;
  - dark `text.muted` `#7A828E` -> `#868E9A`: 4.12:1 on `bg.hover` and
    3.86:1 on `bg.selected`;
  - light status colours, which the brief gives for a dark background
    (2.5-1.6:1 on white), are split into an icon value (3:1) and a text
    value (4.5:1). Icons: `status.critical` `#FF4D4F` (kept, 3.25:1),
    `status.serious` `#E16F18`, `status.caution` `#BE8400`,
    `status.normal` `#00A45D`, `status.standby` `#3496D5`. Text:
    `status.critical.text` `#DA2331`, `status.serious.text` `#BD4E00`,
    `status.caution.text` `#9E6500`, `status.normal.text` `#00833F`,
    `status.standby.text` `#0077B4`;
  - the dark theme's status colours pass as the brief gives them, as icon
    and as text.
- **Text on the accent** is white in the light theme and the dark canvas
  (`#0B0D10`) in the dark theme: white on `#4C8DFF` is 3.2:1.
- **Derived tokens:** `bg.selected` is the brief's accent at 10 % (light)
  or 16 % (dark) over the surface; status and diff tints are the status
  colour at 7 % (light) or 16 % (dark), the most that keeps the status
  text on its own tint at 4.5:1 (at 10 % light it was 4.36-4.44:1); text
  selection is the accent at 22 % / 34 %; disabled text is
  `text.primary` at 38 % (WCAG exempts inactive controls); the accent's
  hover and pressed steps mix 10 % and 20 % of black (light) or white
  (dark).
- **Borders stay low-contrast** (`border.strong` on the surface is 1.5:1):
  the brief asks for "1 px low-contrast borders"; an input is also told
  apart by its fill, its hover edge and its 2 px focus ring, and
  `tests/gui/test_input_borders.py` keeps every input's edge visible.
- **Tooltips are raised surfaces** (`bg.raised`, a 1 px border), not
  inverse: one floating-element style for menus, popovers and tooltips.
- **No shadows:** Qt style sheets cannot draw them; floating elements get
  a 1 px border instead. A `QGraphicsDropShadowEffect` is left to the
  components that need one (M2).

### Chart palette

- **Eight colours per theme, searched in OKLCH and checked with the
  data-visualisation palette validator** (`theme/palettes.py`). A first
  search that also kept the hue bands of every status colour out found no
  eight-colour set; the rule became "at least Delta E 8 from every status
  colour (icon and text values) and from the accent", which keeps a
  series from reading as a status while leaving enough hues.
  - light on `#FFFFFF`: `#AE59B4 #8A3600 #6C25A4 #236400 #00A596 #5283FE
    #B80040 #005F93`; worst adjacent CVD Delta E 14.3 (protan), worst
    adjacent normal-vision Delta E 20.8, all >= 3:1;
  - dark on `#111418`: `#CA4ED3 #B36C0D #8B63B6 #458604 #00A794 #3163F1
    #DA185B #007CB1`; worst adjacent CVD Delta E 14.8 (deutan),
    normal-vision 15.2, all >= 3:1;
  - with all 28 pairs side by side (scatter of eight groups) two pairs
    fall below the floors in each theme: every chart keeps a legend.
- **The time cursor is drawn in the accent**, not in the error red: it is
  a selection, and red is reserved for critical.

### Type and icons

- **Fonts as TTF, not WOFF2:** Qt reads TrueType everywhere; its WOFF2
  support depends on the build.
- **Weights bundled: Inter 400/500/600, JetBrains Mono 400/500;** no
  italics (none is used).
- **Tabular figures:** `theme.numeric_font()` uses Inter with `tnum` on
  Qt 6.7+, JetBrains Mono on older Qt (`pyproject.toml` allows 6.6).
- **Lucide, only the 35 icons used.** The app's names map to Lucide's
  (`theme/icons.py`): Run `play` in the accent, Cancel `circle-stop` in
  critical, Monte Carlo `dices`, Check kernels `file-check`, Vizard
  settings `sliders-horizontal`, Launch Vizard `monitor-play`, 3D model
  `box`; steps `orbit`, `rocket`, `route`, `variable`, `git-branch`,
  `repeat`, `file-text`, `code`.
- **Icons are tinted when drawn** by a `QIconEngine` that reads the token
  each paint, so a live theme change needs no icon to be set again.

### Style sheet

- **One application style sheet, no per-widget sheets.** A widget picks
  its look with dynamic properties (`role`, `tone`, `badge`, `variant`,
  `series`; `theme.set_role`). The 106 `setStyleSheet` calls outside the
  theme became properties; one is left, the swatch of a colour the user
  picked (`palettes.swatch_style`).
- **No `QWidget { ... }` rule:** text colour, selection and the font come
  from the application palette and font. The rule made Qt restyle every
  widget on a switch for nothing (45 ms of the switch).
- **Group boxes are headings, not frames** ("no boxes inside boxes").
- **Rich text** in labels takes its inline CSS from `theme/richtext.py`
  and is rebuilt on a theme change where it holds colours.
- **Item colours** (list, tree and table rows) are set through
  `theme/items.py`, which records the token on the item so `retint`
  recolours a view after a switch.
- **The hard-coded-style test covers strings and font calls:** colours,
  CSS sizes and weights, font families and style sheets outside
  `gui/theme/`. Integer layout margins in code are out of its scope until
  M2-M8 rebuild the screens from components.

### Live theme switch

- **`apply_theme` clears the sheet, then sets the new one:** measured on
  the main window (1,216 widgets), clearing then setting took 210-290 ms
  where swapping one sheet for the other took about 1,000 ms; Qt builds
  the new rules once instead of diffing every widget against the old.
- **Measured** (same machine, same day, the code before M1 (`b064bb9ef`) and this change run in
  turn; `scripts/measure_ui_baseline.py` and a paired script):
  - a fresh main window with template 19 open (1,360 widgets): 0.51-0.55 s,
    against 1.31-1.44 s before M1;
  - in the baseline script's sequence (every page visited, a run done,
    the spacecraft dialog opened): 2.4 s, against 6.1-6.5 s before M1 (the
    plan's 3.8-4.0 s was measured on a faster day).
- **The brief's 100 ms is not met in M1.** The time is Qt re-polishing
  every widget, and most of them are hidden (1,049 of the 1,216 of a new
  window: pages and tabs not shown). M2 hosts the screens in lazily
  created areas; the criterion is carried to M2 with these values.
- **Tried and not taken:** setting the sheet on the main window instead of
  the application halves the switch (200-250 ms on the fresh window) but
  leaves parentless dialogs and tooltips unstyled; revisited in M2.
- **`theme.on_change` holds callbacks weakly** and skips a widget Qt has
  already deleted: a closed dialog's redraw would otherwise raise on its
  deleted children at the next switch (found by the full test suite).
- **Plots redraw after the switch returns** (a zero-time timer), so the
  switch does not wait for the web pages to reload.
- **System follows the desktop live:** with View > Theme > System, a
  change of the platform's colour scheme applies at once.

### Dependencies and outputs

- **No new run-time dependency.** Inter, JetBrains Mono and Lucide are
  files (`docs/THIRD_PARTY_ASSETS.md`). PySide6 and plotly keep their
  ranges (`>=6.6`, `>=5.0`): nothing new depends on a newer version, and
  pinning them is a release decision, not a restyle one.
- **plotly.js is not copied** into the package: the copy in
  `plotly/package_data/` is already bundled with a GUI dependency, offline
  (a second copy would add 4.8 MB).
- **Data exports are unchanged; plot images take the new look.** A PNG or
  SVG of a plot has always taken the theme in use; its data, axes and
  units are the same.

### Records

- **Test changes** are listed in `docs/ui/TEST_CHANGES.md` (plan §9, Q1).
- **`docs/DESIGN.md` is rewritten** for the new system; the Carbon version
  stays in git history.
- **`CLAUDE.md`** (in `SpaceMissionStudio/`) holds the design rules every
  later session follows.

## Decisions from the plan (§10)

- **plotly.js** comes from the plotly package (above).
- **No new runtime dependencies** (above); the licence report is
  `docs/THIRD_PARTY_ASSETS.md`.
- **Status colours:** the brief's Astro values, tuned only where the
  contrast test fails, each tuned value listed above.
- **Categorical plot palette:** 8 hues, validated for CVD separation on
  both surfaces, distinct from the status hues (above).
- **Recent scenarios** (M3) are stored in `QSettings` (organisation
  "AVSLab"): not a file-format change.
- **Run-start and run-end log records** (M5) are emitted by the GUI's run
  controller, not the engine.
- **`docs/DESIGN.md`** is rewritten in M1 (above).
